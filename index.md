  I'm Lu Yang (杨璐), I currently a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Techonology, Shandong Jianzhu University. I received the Ph.D. degree from the Shandong University, Jinan China, advised by Prof. Yilong Yin and Prof. Gongping Yang. My research focused on biometrics and pattern recognition. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Shandong University of Technology, Zibo China, in 2011.
